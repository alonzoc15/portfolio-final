                            Hello I am Alonzo Camille, a software developer that loves finding innovative ways to use technology to make a simple lifestyle for anyone using it. Shortly after graduating from Florida A&M University with a Bachelors of Science in Business Administration
                            I spent one year in the transportation and logistics industry at Penske Truck Rental as a Sales and Operations Management Trainee. After working for over a year I realized that I liked the feeling of being able to wear various
                            hats and connect with people from different backgrounds but I did not find myself emotionally fulfilled from the work I was doing. It was during this time that I had started to challenge myself and learn to code and I had learned
                            to love the feeling of being able build something on my computer. Shortly after I had found the Digital Crafts Software Engineering Immersive and it wasn't long before I was enrolled. The Digital Crafts immersive has been my
                            most satisfying challenge to date and has helped me fulfill a strong desire to create products with value.
